What i did and how i procceed during the exercise :
I tried to do a simple,MVC designed,good-looking project using java on netbeans framework.
First step : fron-end : So first of all i choosed the HTML template that i will use for the site..
i searched for a free template with filters to reach my goals in this exercise.

I download a good template ,with a significant modifications now it's ready,then i tried to use MVC design
pattern by implementing HotelsController servlet which simply take the request ,dispatch it to the
 correct Model,bring the result back and forward the result to the appropriate view.

Then the back-end stage,i built the Models ,(DAO:hotelInfo,Hotel) and offers class which do the request to the
API depends on the filters.

After that i started learning Heruko which was the hardest part, and finally i upload my project 
successfully to Heroku server and push my code to GitHub.
